I need to filter the list by the content of the review. I will locate the filter input field corresponding to the 'Review' column (which is the 6th column with a header, between 'Nickname' and 'Visibility') and type 'satisfied' into it, then press Enter to apply the filter.",
      "instruction": "Type \"satisfied\" into the filter input box directly below the \"Review\" column header.",

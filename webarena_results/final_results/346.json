There are two input fields under the 'Created' header, typically representing 'From' (top) and 'To' (bottom). Currently, the top field contains '12/31/2025' and the bottom field contains '01/01/22'. The previous execution steps indicate that the agent mistakenly typed '01/01/22' into the global search bar (top right) instead of the grid filter. I need to correct this by explicitly targeting the grid filter inputs. My plan is to set the top input (From) to '01/01/22' and the bottom input (To) to '12/31/22'. I will start by typing the start date into the top input field.",

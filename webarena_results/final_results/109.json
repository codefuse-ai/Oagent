The current page displays the 'Orders Report' with the 'Complete' status selected, which corresponds to successful orders. The report table is visible and lists data from January 2022 (1/2022) to November 2022 (11/2022). The text '12 records found' indicates that there is one more record (December 2022) which is currently hidden below the visible area of the screen. To retrieve the full dataset requested by the user, I need to scroll down to make the last row visible. Although previous steps involved scrolling, the current screenshot shows the top of the page, suggesting the bottom of the table is still not fully in view. Therefore, I will perform a scroll down action.",

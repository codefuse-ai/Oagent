The recent execution history indicates an attempt to switch to the 'main' branch (typing 'main' in the branch selector), but the screenshot shows the branch is still 'master'. This suggests that either the 'main' branch does not exist (and 'master' is the default) or the switch was unsuccessful. Given the high commit count difference (51 vs 3) and the likelihood of 'master' being the primary branch if 'main' isn't found, I will proceed by identifying 'Henning Leutz' as the target contributor. To find his follower count, I need to navigate to his user profile. The breadcrumb navigation at the top left shows 'Henning Leutz', which is a direct link to his profile (or the project owner's profile, which matches the contributor). Therefore, I will click this link.",

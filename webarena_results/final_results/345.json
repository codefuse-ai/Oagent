To filter for April 2023, I need to set the date range from '04/01/23' to '04/30/23'. \n\nI will start by correcting the 'To' date because '12/30/2025' is clearly wrong and serves as a good visual anchor. I will type '04/30/23' into this field and press Enter to apply the filter. In the next step, I will set the 'From' date to '04/01/23' to complete the range.

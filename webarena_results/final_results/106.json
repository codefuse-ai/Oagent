According to the provided tips, for GitLab issue-related queries, I should directly construct a URL and use the goto action instead of navigating the UI. The URL format is: http://ecs_ip:8023/<username>/<reponame>/-/issues/?<parameters>. For filtering by a label, the parameter is label_name%5B%5D=<label>. In this case, the username is 'umano', the repository name is 'AndroidSlidingUpPanel', and the label is 'BUG'. Therefore, I will construct the URL: http://ecs_ip:8023/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=BUG. This approach is prioritized as per the tips, which are treated as expert advice.",

Based on the screenshot, the page displays posts with scores in descending order starting from the 5th post (3611, 3448, 3419, 3365, 3295), which indicates the page is already sorted by 'Top' and 'All time'. The first 4 posts have a score of -1 and are likely pinned posts or announcements, which I have already downvoted in previous steps (indicated by the blue down arrows). To fulfill the request of downvoting the 'top 5 posts ever', I should downvote the posts with the highest scores, which start from the 5th visible post. The first of these is the post starting with 'Comcast wanted $210,000...'. I will proceed to downvote this post.",

Based on the tips, I must first search for 'University of Pittsburgh' to establish the starting point, which has been done. The next step is to find the nearest In-N-Out. Since I don't know its exact name or location, I must visually scan the map around the University of Pittsburgh to locate the nearest In-N-Out restaurant. The map is currently displayed, but I need to zoom in or scroll to get a better view of the surrounding area to identify the restaurant. However, according to the tips, for queries about the closest place, I should visually scan the map after searching for the reference location. Since the map is already showing the University of Pittsburgh, I should now look for In-N-Out on the map. But to do that effectively, I need to zoom in on the map to see more details. The tips explicitly state to use 'zoom_in' and 'zoom_out' actions for map zooming, not scroll. Therefore, I will zoom in on the map to get a closer look at the area around the University of Pittsburgh to locate the nearest In-N-Out.",

This indicates the correct filters are already applied. The previous steps involved typing the label filter and scrolling. To fulfill the request of listing 'all' issues, I need to continue scrolling down to reveal more issues or reach the pagination controls, as the current view only shows a portion of the list. Although the tips suggest a URL-first strategy, the agent is already on the correct page, so reloading with a constructed URL (which would require guessing the username, likely 'root') is unnecessary and risks a 404. Continuing to scroll is the most efficient and safe action to complete the listing process.",
